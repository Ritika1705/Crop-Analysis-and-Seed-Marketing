# Crop-Analysis-and-Seed-Marketing

In this project, I have tried to build a model that predicts the type of crop that can be cultivated in a given land on the basis of climatic conditions. Therefore, the crop with maximum production probability for a given area of land can be cultivated and thus in this way, the resources and hard work of the farmers would be optimized and will give better results. This model would also help in effective seed marketing as the predictive analysis of the suitable crop.
